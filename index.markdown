~~This is an "old school" blog using only HTML, CSS, and perhaps a little javascript. No fancy frameworks here...~~ ~~I decided to use [hexo](https://hexo.io) for the sake of convenience.~~ Version 3! Using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) now... It just so happens that markdown is much more friendly for blogging.
