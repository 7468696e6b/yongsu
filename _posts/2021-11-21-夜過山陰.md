## Of the Mountain shade by night

明代：王稚登\
Ming dynasty: Wang Zhideng

一曲清溪一曲歌，風流其奈昔人何。\
Singing streams and singing song, how did passerby to these windy times belong?

暮山非雪看皆白，流水如琴聽亦多。\
Dusk's mount without snow still seems paled, waters flowing rustle as if strums echoed long.

謝墅無棋那可賭，蘭亭有酒且相過。\
Manors without chess to gamble upon, at least the orchid pavilion has wine to merriment along. 

盤餐莫笑茅容饌，明日書成好換鵝。\
Laugh not at these plates of cottongrass fare, tomorrow's studies shall have goose meat to tong.
