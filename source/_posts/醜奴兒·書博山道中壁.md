## Chounu'er - letter from the escarpment at Boshan mountain

宋代：辛棄疾
Song dynasty: Xin Qiji

少年不識愁滋味，愛上層樓。
In youth, happy ignorance of affairs agonized, joyous in ascent of that storied tower.

愛上層樓，為賦新詞強說愁。
Joyously ascending that storied tower, if only to bear more prosody to those long agonies.

而今識盡愁滋味，欲說還休。
Today seeking to cease such affairs agonized, to set forth for respite.

欲說還休，却道天涼好個秋。
To set forth for respite, knowing that the days shall cool and autumn shall set in.
